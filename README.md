# X-ray flux scripts
This repository provides scripts for the assembly and maintenance of datasets on X-ray fluxes emitted by the Sun. The datasets on which these scripts work are available in the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - NOAA site](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/spaceweather.html), specifically in [https://satdat-vip.ngdc.noaa.gov/sem/goes/data/new_full](https://satdat-vip.ngdc.noaa.gov/sem/goes/data/new_full).

The data already processed is available on the Zenodo website available at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.840402.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.840402).

## Motivation for collecting this data
The main motivation for collecting this data is use it as a time series for X-ray flux forecasting.

## Scripts language
We wrote the scripts for the Bourne Again Shell (bash) and try our best to document them well. The scripts use common bash commands like awk, cat, echo, read and rm. Therefore, you should not have any problem running them on Linux operating system.

## Sample datasets
This repository also contains some sample datasets to run the scripts. Do not forget to download all data you need from the NOAA site indicated in the [first section of this text](#x-ray-flux-scripts).
